### How it works?
Preprocessing is done by generating a TRIE data structure by reading corncob_lowercase.txt which contains meaningful English words. \
Then a normal DFS is done on the input 2D grid and words are compared with our generated TRIE to check meaningful words which can be generated using the input grid.
